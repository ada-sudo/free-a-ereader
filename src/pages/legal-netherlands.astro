  <h2>Legal Information on Jailbreaking E-Readers in Europe and the Netherlands</h2>

  <p>Understanding the legal framework around jailbreaking is important to make informed decisions.</p>

  <h3>European Union</h3>
  <p>Under EU law, jailbreaking or circumventing digital rights management (DRM) for personal use is generally allowed, as long as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You own the device</li>
    <li>The purpose is to enhance usability or customize your device</li>
    <li>You do not use it to infringe copyright (e.g., piracy)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Netherlands Specific Regulations</h3>
  <p>The Netherlands supports the right to modify owned hardware. Jailbreaking for personal customization and extended functionality is legally acceptable.</p>

  <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Jailbreaking may void manufacturer warranties</li>
    <li>Illegal distribution or piracy remains prohibited</li>
    <li>Legislation can change; stay updated and consult legal advice if unsure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have any legal concerns, please seek professional advice or consult official resources.</p>
